## Things to learn

## Site / content structure

### /content

Contains all of the actual files which house all of your content. 

The main index page is the one file in the content directory. 

All other pages must be in their own folder. So, if you wanted a page that showed all of, for example, sprout pictures, and you wanted to create a page called sprout-pictures, create a folder called sprout-pictures and create an index.md file within. 

### /_includes

This contains the templates for the content. 
Please don't touch these!
